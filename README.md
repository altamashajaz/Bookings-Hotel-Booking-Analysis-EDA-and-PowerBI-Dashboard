# Bookings : Hotel Booking Analysis | EDA and PowerBI Dashboard

## Problem Statement

The hospitality industry is highly competitive and influenced by dynamic customer behaviors, seasonal trends, and market conditions. Hotels face challenges such as managing cancellations, optimizing occupancy rates, and tailoring services to diverse customer preferences. The goal of this project is to leverage data to address these challenges by identifying actionable insights and driving data-informed strategies for operational efficiency and business growth.

## Overview

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel bookings data to extract meaningful insights that inform strategic decision-making, optimize hotel operations, and enhance overall business performance. The dataset includes variables such as hotel types, booking patterns, customer demographics, revenue sources, and cancellation trends. You can view the interactive PowerBI dashboard here.

## Key Objectives

- Enhance Booking Efficiency: Identify factors influencing booking patterns to maximize occupancy rates and revenue generation.

- Reduce Booking Cancellations: Understand drivers behind cancellations and implement measures to minimize them.

- Improve Customer Experience: Gain insights into customer preferences to tailor services and enhance guest satisfaction.

- Optimize Resource Allocation: Utilize data-driven insights to optimize staffing and room inventory management.

- Inform Strategic Decision-Making: Provide actionable insights to inform strategic decisions and drive sustainable business growth.

## Key Findings

Seasonal Trends:

Peak booking periods coincide with holiday seasons and specific months, with notable differences between city hotels and resort hotels.

Off-season periods show low occupancy, presenting opportunities for promotional campaigns.

Cancellation Insights:

Higher cancellation rates are observed for online bookings, particularly for customers without prior stays.

Long lead times and group bookings correlate with elevated cancellation probabilities.

Revenue Sources:

Direct bookings generate higher revenue per booking compared to online travel agents.

Resort hotels tend to yield higher average revenue per stay compared to city hotels.

Customer Demographics:

Families and couples dominate the customer base, with significant preferences for specific room types.

International guests show longer stays and higher spending patterns compared to domestic travelers.

Guest Preferences:

Preference for flexible cancellation policies impacts booking decisions.

Advanced planning is more common among repeat guests.

Recommendations

Promote Off-Season Offers: Create targeted marketing campaigns with discounts and packages to attract guests during low-demand periods.

Optimize Booking Policies: Introduce incentives for non-refundable bookings while maintaining flexibility for premium customers.

Personalized Experiences: Leverage customer preferences to offer tailored packages and room options for returning guests.

Streamline Operations: Adjust staffing and room inventory based on seasonal forecasts and booking trends.

Improve Direct Booking Channels: Enhance the website and mobile application to encourage more direct bookings, reducing dependency on third-party platforms.
